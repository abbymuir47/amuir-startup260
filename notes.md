# NOTES
## This is my notes file for the semester!
### Today I learned that md files have their own kind of syntax. I created my repository for my startup project!

### Web domain name notes:
- You can get the IP address for any domain name using the “dig” console function (one domain name can have multiple IP addresses in case the others don’t respond)
- Owner of the root domain can make as many subdomains as he/she wants
- “whois” console function gives you info about a domain/who owns it, etc
- DNS = domain name system, address(A)= domain name→ IP vs canonical name records (CNAME)= domain name → other domain name
