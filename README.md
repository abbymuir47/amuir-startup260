## Specification Deliverable 
### Elevator Pitch
Do you feel like a jack of all trades, master of none? Me too. I have always wanted a space to record or display my various creative endeavors or adventures, but a social media page doesn’t quite cut it. There are different outlets, such as music, resin art, or crochet projects which I would like to display in a more organized portfolio. For my startup project I am going to create a personal portfolio website which can function as a sort of blog as well. I will add functionality so that those who visit the website can create a profile and leave comments and messages. This way, they can leave feedback or ask how I created a certain project. The website can be a collaborative space for people who love to create and explore like me.

### Technologies 
HTML - Use HTML to create multiple pages. My portfolio will have various dropdown menus and pages to navigate between, so I will structure these with HTML
CSS - Apply CSS with design principles so that my web page is visually pleasing as a portfolio. Create art collages, use whitespace to differentiate between projects. 
JavaScript - Allow for user interaction. Ability to click buttons, enter text. 
React - Enable user login, ability to “like” a project or leave a comment, and send messages. 
Service - Use endpoints to listen for login info, likes, comments, saves, messages, and changes to user data
Authentication - Enable username and password so that users can visit the site and save their data repeatedly.
Database data - Store user data such as login information, profile pictures, likes, comments, saves, and messages. Secure data storage for safe, repeated access.
WebSocket - Enables like count and comments to be displayed to all users. Like count and comments are updated for all users.
